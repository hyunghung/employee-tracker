# employee-tracker

For this project, I was working with SQL databases, to create a database for a company. Within this code, I had different functionalities such as, viewing all departments, employees, and even adding employees and roles to the company. I did this by utlizing SQL along with MYSQL2, Node.js and Inquirer.
